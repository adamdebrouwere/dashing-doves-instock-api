# Instock API
##About
This was a project I contributed to while completing my software engineering deploma at Brainstation. I worked with a team  using Node.js and Express, along with mySql and KENX.js to create a CRUD system where a user can see the inventory of a given warehouse, and create remove update and delete warehouses and inventory.
